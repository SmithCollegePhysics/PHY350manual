F1
: **data repositories and notebooks**: students should be able to keep online notebooks and respositories of their data and activities sufficient in clarity and detail to serve as the source for all data presentation and analysis presented in scientific communications

This includes: (1) using technical vocabulary appropriate for the physics content and apparatus used, (2) stating measurement and analysis data with significant digits and uncertainty, (3) presenting data in tables and plots, and (4) making scientific diagrams or schematics of the apparatus/system 

F3
: **scientific reasoning**: students should be able to develop clearly stated scientific arguments that proceed from a clearly stated question to the presentation of the evidence, the evaluation of that evidence, and the data-driven / evidence-based conclusions

F4
