:::{glossary}

B1
: **conceptual framework**: Students should be able to choose the appropriate conceptual framework(s) for the physical situation being modeled; combining model representations when needed to provide complete analysis of a given investigation.

B2
: **model-dependent assumptions**: Students should be able to check and understand the assumptions, limitations, and simplifications inherent in their model and the biases/ uncertainties that might be introduced by these.

B3
: **units and estimation**: Students should be able to estimate, using appropriate units, both input parameters to and output values from a model of a system. In particular, students should be able to carry out back-of-the-envelope or order of magnitude estimates of the expected results of an experiment and do a preliminary analysis of the data to see if the results are reasonable before making detailed / fine-grained measurements. 

B4
: **application of model to data**: Students should be able to apply physical models and their mathematical representation to the analysis of data, carrying out any derivations need to put the models in suitable form.
