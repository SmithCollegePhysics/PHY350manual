# FAIR Data Principles 

The FAIR Data Principles is a set of guiding principles that state that data should be findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable. They address the usability of datasets as well as their availability.

:open: true

- To make data findable, data and supplementary materials should have sufficiently detailed descriptive metadata as well as a unique and persistent identifier such as a digital object identifier (DOI).
- To be accessible, the metadata and data should be understandable to both humans and machines, and data should be stored in a trusted repository.
- To be interoperable, metadata should use a formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language for knowledge representation, such as agreed-upon controlled vocabularies.
- To be reusable, data and collections should have a clear usage license and provide accurate information on provenance.

Read [The FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management and stewardship](https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.18) for a more in-depth explanation of and rationale for FAIR principles.

We will use [Open Science Framework (OSF.IO)](https://www.cos.io/products/osf) —  free and open source project management tool and data repository — for FAIR data compliance.
