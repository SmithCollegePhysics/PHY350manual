:::{glossary}
A1
: **falsifiable hypotheses**: students should be able to devise  and experimentally test  competing 'falsifiable' hypotheses to  explain observable features of nature

A2
: **understands experiments**: students should be able to clearly, accurately, and succintly describe experimental observations and identify the most important physics concepts in an experiment

A3
: **knowledge transfer**: Students  should  be  able  to  transfer knowledge  between  different  contexts, recognize  connections  between  different concepts,  and  reason  by  induction  to produce  generalizations

A4
: **ethical practice**: students should be able to conduct experiments, perform analyses, and disseminate results in a professional and ethical manner as responsible scientists. Students should not engage in fabrication, falsification, or plagiarism

B1
: **conceptual framework**: students should be able to choose the appropriate conceptual framework(s) for the physical situation being modeled; combining model representations when needed to provide complete analysis of a given investigation

B2
: **model-dependent assumptions**: students should be able to check and understand the assumptions, limitations, and simplifications inherent in their model and the biases/ uncertainties that might be introduced by these

B3
: **units and estimation**: students should be able to estimate, using appropriate units, both input parameters to and output values from a model of a system. In particular, students should be able to carry out back-of-the-envelope or order of magnitude estimates of the expected results of an experiment and do a preliminary analysis of the data to see if the results are reasonable before making detailed / fine-grained measurements 

B4
: **application of model to data**: students should be able to apply physical models and their mathematical representation to the analysis of data, carrying out any derivations need to put the models in suitable form 

C1
: **experimental design**: students should be able to plan/design an experimental investigation, taking into account  relevant physical principles and the types, amount, and accuracy of data needed to give reproducible and accurate results; planning should include use of a literature review used to refine a question or improve the design

C2
: **apparatus assembly and testing**: students should be able to assemble a complete measurement apparatus from individual components to carry out an experimental investigation

C3
: **experimental design limitations**: students should be able to understand the limitations of their experimental design, including potential sources of systematic error

C4
: **troubleshooting and iteration**: students should be able to take an iterative, logical approach to troubleshooting their apparatus and refining their measurements and apparatus design; Students should also be able to reflect on their preliminary results and make use of the opportunity to make improvements before proceeding further

D1
: **signal capture with oscilloscopes**: students should be able to adjust signal coupling, set up external synchronization and triggering,  perform peak detection and measurement, apply averaging, and make use of freq analysis to capture signals using oscilloscopes

D2
: **signal recovery with lock-ins**: students should be able to set up measurements involving signal modulation and synchronization,  adjust signal coupling, perform frequency/phase sensitive detection (including harmonics),  and apply filtering and averaging  to recover signals from noise using lock-in amplifiers

D3
: **event detection with counter-timers**: students should be able to optimize threshold, gain, and offsets, determine background/dark count, and carry out coincidence detection to detect events and infer signal/noise ratios using counter/timers and discriminators

D4
: **signal characterization with multimeters**: students should be able to configure sensors and multimeters (including adjustments to sensitivity, range, aperature, offsets and zero correction) to carry out signal averaging, generate histograms, determine means and standard deviations, and separate random, systematic,and drift related errors using multimeters for standard dc current and voltage measurements

E1
: **statistical analysis**: students should be able to make plots and tables, do curve-fitting, be proficient in basic statical analysis, and learn the most common higher-level statistical analyses: Poisson and Gaussian statistics, correlations, Bayesian analysis, general uncertainty analysis and confidence intervals  

E2
: **data visualization**: students should be able to select from a variety of plot formats those most useful and relevant to their experiment and be able to extract information from these plots. examples of commonly used plot formats include log-log, log-lin, polar, Bode , contour, heat map, power law, linear, and Fourier transform frequency plots  

E3
: **data filtering and smoothing**: students should be able to use basic methods of smoothing and filtering data sets to remove noise. Students should also be able to use background subtraction, differentiation, and peak fitting to better resolve and identify small features in the data 

E4
: **curve fitting to data**: students should be able to do curve fitting using non-linear regression, relate the fit parameters to physical quantities, and use a chi-square test to determine an overall goodness of fit 

F1
: **data repositories and notebooks**: students should be able to keep online notebooks and respositories of their data and activities sufficient in clarity and detail to serve as the source for all data presentation and analysis presented in scientific communications

F2
: **technical communication components**: students should be able to make scientific arguments using a number of standard elements of technical communication. This includes: (1) using technical vocabulary appropriate for the physics content and apparatus used, (2) stating measurement and analysis data with significant digits and uncertainty, (3) presenting data in tables and plots, and (4) making scientific diagrams or schematics of the apparatus/system 

F3
: **scientific reasoning**: students should be able to develop clearly stated scientific arguments that proceed from a clearly stated question to the presentation of the evidence, the evaluation of that evidence, and the data-driven / evidence-based conclusions

F4
: **scientific articles**: students should be able to communicate their results ethically and effectively in forms authentic to the discipline. Students should not plagiarize or be intentionally misleading in disseminating their results
