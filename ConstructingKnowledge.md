A1
: **falsifiable hypothesis**: Students should be able to devise  and experimentally test  competing 'falsifiable' hypotheses to  explain observable features of nature.

A2
: **understands experiments**: Students should be able to clearly, accurately, and succinctly describe experimental observations and identify the most important physics concepts in an experiment.

A3
: **knowledge transfer**: Students  should  be  able  to  transfer knowledge  between  different  contexts, recognize  connections  between  different concepts,  and  reason  by  induction  to produce  generalizations.

A4
: **ethical practice**: Students should be able to conduct experiments, perform analyses, and disseminate results in a professional and ethical manner as responsible scientists. Students should not engage in fabrication, falsification, or plagiarism.
