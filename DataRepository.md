# Create an Open Science Foundation Data Repository

## sign up for an account  

1. Sign up for an OSF account using your college email address. 
2. Look for email confirmation, then sign in to OSF.IO

## create a new data repository ("project")

1. Open the Getting Started instructions: 
2. Scroll down to find  instructions for option 2: `Start a Project from a Template`. 
3. Find the second method for implementing option 2,  titled   `using a public project as template`
4. Follow those instructions to create an OSF project of your own based on the following template: `PHY 350 Experimental Physics Template`
5. Give the project the name PHY350-Your-Name, then add your instructors as contributors with read/write access.
