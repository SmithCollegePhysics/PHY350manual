E1
: **statistical analysis**: students should be able to make plots and tables, do curve-fitting, be proficient in basic statical analysis, and learn the most common higher-level statistical analyses: Poisson and Gaussian statistics, correlations, Bayesian analysis, general uncertainty analysis and confidence intervals  

E2
: **data visualization**: students should be able to select from a variety of plot formats those most useful and relevant to their experiment and be able to extract information from these plots. examples of commonly used plot formats include log-log, log-lin, polar, Bode , contour, heat map, power law, linear, and Fourier transform frequency plots  

E3
: **data filtering and smoothing**: students should be able to use basic methods of smoothing and filtering data sets to remove noise. Students should also be able to use background subtraction, differentiation, and peak fitting to better resolve and identify small features in the data 

E4
: **curve fitting to data**: students should be able to do curve fitting using non-linear regression, relate the fit parameters to physical quantities, and use a chi-square test to determine an overall goodness of fit
