:::{glossary}

D1
: **signal capture with oscilloscopes**: students should be able to adjust signal coupling, set up external synchronization and triggering,  perform peak detection and measurement, apply averaging, and make use of freq analysis to capture signals using oscilloscopes

D2
: **signal recovery with lock-ins**: students should be able to set up measurements involving signal modulation and synchronization,  adjust signal coupling, perform frequency/phase sensitive detection (including harmonics),  and apply filtering and averaging  to recover signals from noise using lock-in amplifiers

D3
: **event detection with counter-timers**: students should be able to optimize threshold, gain, and offsets, determine background/dark count, and carry out coincidence detection to detect events and infer signal/noise ratios using counter/timers and discriminators

D4
: **signal characterization with multimeters**: students should be able to configure sensors and multimeters (including adjustments to sensitivity, range, aperature, offsets and zero correction) to carry out signal averaging, generate histograms, determine means and standard deviations, and separate random, systematic,and drift related errors using multimeters for standard dc current and voltage measurements
