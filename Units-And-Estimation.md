# Units and Estimation

Students should be able to estimate, using appropriate units, both input parameters to and output values from a model of a system. In particular, students should be able to carry out back-of-the-envelope or order of magnitude estimates of the expected results of an experiment and do a preliminary analysis of the data to see if the results are reasonable before making detailed / fine-grained measurements.
