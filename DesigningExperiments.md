:::{glossary}


C1
: **experimental design**: students should be able to plan/design an experimental investigation, taking into account  relevant physical principles and the types, amount, and accuracy of data needed to give reproducible and accurate results; planning should include use of a literature review used to refine a question or improve the design

C2
: **apparatus assembly and testing**: students should be able to assemble a complete measurement apparatus from individual components to carry out an experimental investigation

C3
: **experimental design limitations**: students should be able to understand the limitations of their experimental design, including potential sources of systematic error

C4
: **troubleshooting and iteration**: students should be able to take an iterative, logical approach to troubleshooting their apparatus and refining their measurements and apparatus design; Students should also be able to reflect on their preliminary results and make use of the opportunity to make improvements before proceeding further
